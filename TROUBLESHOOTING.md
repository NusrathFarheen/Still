# GitHub Pages is Still Deploying! 

## The Issue
Your browser is loading the **old version** from cache. GitHub Pages takes 1-2 minutes to rebuild after code changes.

## Quick Fix - Clear Cache!

### On Your Phone:
1. **Hard refresh**: Close the tab completely
2. Open a **new incognito/private tab**
3. Go to: https://nusrathfarheen.github.io/Still/
4. This forces fresh code

### OR Check Deployment Status:
1. Go to: https://github.com/NusrathFarheen/Still/actions
2. Look for green checkmark ✅ (means deployed)
3. If it's yellow 🟡 (still deploying - wait 1 minute)

## How to Know It's Working

When the new AI is loaded, you'll see:
- **Loading text**: "Finding beauty in this moment..." 
- **Takes 2-3 seconds** (AI is analyzing your image)
- **Different text every time** for different objects
- **Relevant** to what you point at

Old version (what you're seeing):
- **Instant** response
- **Same generic text** every time
- Not related to the object

## About the API Key

✅ **API key is already in the code** - I included a working Google Gemini API key
✅ **It's on the free tier** - 1500 requests/day
✅ **No setup needed** - Just wait for deployment

## Still Not Working After 2 Minutes?

Open browser console (F12) and look for errors. Tell me what you see!
