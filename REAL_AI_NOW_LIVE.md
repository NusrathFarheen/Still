# 🎉 REAL AI IS NOW LIVE!

## What Changed

**Before**: Mock AI that randomly guessed objects → Generic, repetitive reflections

**Now**: Real Google Gemini 2.0 Flash vision → Actually sees what you're photographing!

---

## How It Works Now

1. **You point camera** at something (cat, hand, floor, anything)
2. **Gemini AI analyzes** the actual image
3. **AI generates** a relevant, beautiful reflection about what it sees
4. **You get** context-aware, unique responses every time!

3. Point at different things
4. See REAL, relevant reflections!

## What You'll See (Examples)

**Point at a cat:**
> "Cats have been curling up in warm spots for thousands of years. This one doesn't worry about yesterday or tomorrow. Just warmth, just now."

**Point at your hand:**
> "Your hands have held so many things - some you remember, some forgotten. They've learned, built, and reached out. They tell a story only you know."

**Point at a floor:**
> "How many footsteps have crossed this spot? People rushing to somewhere important, or just wandering home. You're one of them."

**Point at rain on a window:**
> "Water finds its way down the glass the same way it has for millions of years. Each drop catches a tiny piece of the world outside. Watching it is like watching time itself move slowly."

## The Magic

Every reflection is:
- ✅ **Unique** - Generated fresh based on what AI actually sees
- ✅ **Relevant** - About the object in your photo
- ✅ **Beautiful** - Simple, accessible, touching
- ✅ **Free** - Using Google's free tier API
