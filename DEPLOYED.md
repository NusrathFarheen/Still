## What's Changed:
✅ **Simpler, more beautiful reflections** - Less overly poetic, more accessible
✅ **Smarter object detection** - Uses image features (brightness, warmth, texture) to guess what you're looking at
✅ **Pushed to GitHub** - All code is now online!

## What You'll See:

### Simplified Reflections (Examples):

**Tree:**
> "This tree has been here longer than you have. It watched seasons change, storms pass, and people come and go. Right now, it's just here—steady and patient."

**Sky:**
> "The same sky that's above you now was here before cities existed. Everyone who ever lived has looked up at it. It makes us all feel small and connected at once."

**Person:**
> "Every person you see carries a whole life you'll never know. They have memories, dreams, and stories that would fill books. You just crossed paths for this one moment."

**Coffee:**
> "Someone grew these beans, someone shipped them, someone roasted them. A lot of quiet work went into this simple moment of warmth in your hands."

## How It Detects Objects (Mock AI):

The app analyzes your image:
- **Bright + Warm** = Sky or sunset
- **Warm + Soft** = Person or coffee
- **High detail + Texture** = Tree or building
- **Cool + Dark** = Night scene
- **Everything else** = Book, flower, street, or window

It's not perfect but it's smart enough to feel magical! When you add real AI later, it'll be even better.

## Next Steps (Optional):

1. **Test it thoroughly** on your phone
2. Let me know if you want to:
   - Integrate real AI (Google Cloud Vision + Gemini)
   - Add more object types
   - Adjust the reflections
   - Change the design

Enjoy your beautiful app! 🌟
